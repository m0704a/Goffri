Goffi is a JavaScript framework for loading HTML fragments into your page, creating screen widgets (Goffries)
A goffri can be anything from a window-sized div through a table cell down to an HTML element's attribute - such as "value".
Goffri currently uses AJAX requests and callbacks to fill the contents of such a goffri.
Goffri also has a place to hold all available actions for a goffri, so to load, save, refresh, validate, etc. is easier since all actions are in one place.
Goffri currently uses jQuery to do most of the work, although not tied to jQuery.
You can use your favorite js framework with Goffi although I will use jQuery only. You are free (and welcome) to add the framework of your choice to Goffri.
